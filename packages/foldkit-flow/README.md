# FoldKit Flow

Graph editing with state owned by your application. The pure TypeScript core has
no runtime dependencies. The optional `/foldkit` entry renders HTML nodes and SVG
edges through your existing FoldKit builder. ELK is available separately as
`@opsydyn/foldkit-flow-elk`.

Version 0.1.0 is a local release candidate; npm publication has not been performed.

## Install

After publication:

```sh
npm install @opsydyn/foldkit-flow
# Only for the native view:
npm install foldkit@0.170.0 effect@4.1.0 @effect/platform-browser@4.1.0
```

For this checkout, use the checked tarball described in
[the publication guide](https://github.com/opsydyn/fold-kit-experiments/blob/main/docs/releases/foldkit-flow.md). ESM only, Node 22+
for tooling. The view is for browsers; pure imports do not access browser globals.
The tested view baseline is FoldKit 0.170.0 / Effect 4.1.0. Both are optional peers.

## Core

```ts
import { createEditor, updateEditor, serializeGraph, parseGraph } from '@opsydyn/foldkit-flow';
import type { FlowGraph } from '@opsydyn/foldkit-flow';

const graph: FlowGraph = {
  nodes: [
    {
      id: 'source',
      label: 'Source',
      position: { x: 40, y: 40 },
      size: { width: 180, height: 90 },
      ports: [{ id: 'out', kind: 'output', side: 'right', offset: 0.5 }],
    },
  ],
  edges: [],
};
const editor = createEditor(graph);
const selected = updateEditor(editor, { type: 'NodeSelected', id: 'source', additive: false });
const moved = updateEditor(selected, { type: 'SelectionNudged', delta: { x: 20, y: 0 } });
const document = serializeGraph(moved.graph);
const restored = createEditor(parseGraph(document));
```

Keep the editor in your Model. Nodes have stable IDs, positions, positive dimensions
and named input/output ports. Port offsets are fractions of the chosen side. Edges
refer to both node and port IDs. Optional node/edge `data` accepts finite JSON data.
Functions reject duplicate IDs, invalid sizes and missing/wrong-direction endpoints
with `FlowError`. JSON syntax errors remain `SyntaxError`.

`updateEditor(state, event, { canConnect })` lets the application reject a proposed
connection with a reason or accept it with `null`. Cycles are allowed by the core.
Exact duplicate connections are ignored with a notice. The policy is supplied by
the host on each update; it is not serialized into the Model.

Each completed drag, keyboard nudge, graph edit or accepted layout is one undo
transaction. Escape restores the pre-drag positions. The default history limit is
100 (configurable from 0 to 1000). Measurements update dimensions without creating
history entries. Undo and measurements advance the revision used to reject stale
layout results. Selection, viewport, gestures and history are excluded from saved
documents. Applications own storage and migration beyond document version 1.

## FoldKit view

```ts
import { flowView } from '@opsydyn/foldkit-flow/foldkit';
import type { EditorEvent, EditorState } from '@opsydyn/foldkit-flow';
import type { HtmlBuilder } from 'foldkit/html';

function view(h: HtmlBuilder<EditorEvent>, editor: EditorState) {
  return flowView(h, editor, {
    id: 'my-flow',
    label: 'Workflow editor',
    onEvent: (event) => event,
    renderNode: (node, builder) => builder.p([], [node.label]),
  });
}
```

Use a document-unique `id`. Custom nodes use the parent's builder and normal
FoldKit messages. Inputs, textareas, selects and editable content keep their normal
behaviour. Add `data-flow-no-drag` to custom interactive areas as needed. Native
input and ResizeObserver resources are acquired by Mount and released on unmount;
input observation stops while DevTools displays a historical view. Resuming input
cancels any unfinished gesture retained in that Model snapshot.

- Drag node titles; Shift-click titles to select several. Drag the background to pan.
- Scroll over the surface to zoom around the pointer (0.1–4). The surface owns touch
  gestures; this initial version supports one pointer, not pinch zoom.
- Tab to titles; Enter/Space selects and arrow keys move. Shift uses larger steps.
- Activate an output port, then an input port, by mouse or keyboard to connect.
- Escape cancels. Delete removes selected nodes and their incident edges together.
- Cmd/Ctrl+Z undoes; Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+Y redoes. Text fields retain native undo.
- Connection buttons below the surface provide keyboard selection of edges.

The view measures node content. Width is controlled by `node.size.width`; height
follows content, with a 64px minimum. Fit through `fitViewport(graph, editor.surface)`
after the surface has reported dimensions. Zoom limits can prevent fitting extremely
large graphs. When replacing a document on an existing mounted surface, preserve
`editor.surface` (as the example's load handler does). Read-only editors retain
selection and viewport navigation.

Styles use ordinary HTML, inline geometry, and optional CSS variables:
`--flow-background`, `--flow-node-background`, `--flow-node-color`. No CSS import or
module registration is needed. Custom node content must remain accessible.

## Optional layout

Create a `layoutRequest(editor, uniqueRequestId)`, store it as the active request,
then run your chosen `LayoutEngine` in a Command. On completion pass the **current
active request** to `applyLayout(editor, active, result)`. The result is accepted
only if the request ID and revision still match and no gesture is active. Clear
the active request when loading/replacing a document; request IDs must not be reused
while old results can still arrive. Rendering never starts layout work.

Manual positioning has no layout dependency. The adapter receives a detached
snapshot; it cannot mutate the Model. All node positions are required exactly
once. Routes are optional, keyed by edge ID; node movement invalidates them and
the view uses straight lines until another arrange result is applied.

## Example and checks

Run `bun run --filter @opsydyn/web dev` and open `/flow` for custom text controls,
connections, ELK arrange, undo, save and reload. Storage belongs to that example.

```sh
bun run --filter @opsydyn/foldkit-flow typecheck
bun run --filter @opsydyn/foldkit-flow test
bun run --filter @opsydyn/foldkit-flow pack:check
```

Initial scope: flat graphs, click-to-connect, single-pointer editing and bounded
history. Collaboration, execution,
virtualization and general layout algorithms are future work. Automated browser
checks do not establish assistive-technology or physical-touch acceptance.

Use `NodeWidthChanged` to commit an authored width while the view continues to
measure content height. `EdgeDataChanged` commits application-owned JSON metadata.
Both participate in undo/redo and graph serialization. The FoldKit view's
`edgeAppearance` callback can read edge data to customize stroke, width and dash
pattern. The editor still highlights the selected edge.

Set `resizeHandles: true` on the FoldKit view to enable pointer resizing.
The handles adjust width while height follows content. The drag range is 140
to 320 graph units, extended to include an existing width outside that range.
Escape or pointer cancellation restores the starting width. Releasing commits
one undo step. Provide a keyboard control via `NodeWidthChanged` when enabling
handles in an editable view.

Drag from an output port to see a preview and highlight an eligible input.
You can also activate an output and then an input with Enter or Space.
The editor announces completion or cancellation in its status region.

Send `EdgeReconnected` with an edge ID, the end to replace, and the new port.
The editor checks port direction, duplicates, and the connection policy before
committing one undo step. The policy receives the proposed edge and the graph
with the previous version of that edge removed.

### Scoped themes and Pleat

Set `themeClassName` on a Flow view to scope a theme to that editor. Existing
CSS variables still inherit from ancestors. A host using Pleat can combine a
class from `cssClass()` with a CSS class that maps its semantic theme tokens
to the Flow variables. Pleat owns the host theme and style registration.

| Part        | CSS variables                                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Canvas      | `--flow-background`, `--flow-canvas-border`                                               |
| Node        | `--flow-node-background`, `--flow-node-color`, `--flow-node-border`, `--flow-node-radius` |
| Ports       | `--flow-input-port`, `--flow-output-port`, `--flow-port-border`, `--flow-control-color`   |
| Edges       | `--flow-edge`, `--flow-edge-width`                                                        |
| Interaction | `--flow-selection`, `--flow-valid-target`, `--flow-resize-background`                     |

For example, given a Pleat theme that exposes the app's semantic CSS tokens:

```css
.release-flow-theme {
  --flow-background: var(--app-surface);
  --flow-node-background: var(--app-panel);
  --flow-node-color: var(--app-text);
  --flow-selection: var(--app-accent);
}
```

Pass `themeClassName: 'release-flow-theme'` in the Flow view options. To apply
a Pleat style directly to the root as well, append its `cssClass(style)` result.
A per-edge `edgeAppearance` stroke or width takes precedence over the default
edge tokens, and the selection token controls the selected stroke.
See [Pleat's FoldKit and theme APIs](https://github.com/Manzanita-Research/pleat#theming).

Select an edge to expose its endpoint handles. Drag either handle to a
compatible port to reconnect the edge. Escape or dropping elsewhere cancels.
Hosts can offer the same edit through keyboard controls using `EdgeReconnected`.

A node with `kind: 'group'` draws a boundary. Set a node's `parentId` to a
group ID to make it a member. Groups can contain other groups. Positions
remain in canvas coordinates, including inside a group. Dragging or nudging a
group moves its descendants once, even when some are also selected. Deleting
a group deletes its descendants and their connections in one undo step.

Group membership is explicit. Layout engines can return an optional size on a
group position to fit the boundary to its children. The ELK adapter arranges
both flat and nested graphs.

`SelectionGrouped` wraps selected siblings in a new boundary sized to their
contents. `SelectionUngrouped` removes selected boundaries and promotes their
contents to the nearest remaining parent. Both preserve canvas positions and
connections and commit one undo step.

Shift-drag the canvas background to draw a selection box. Releasing selects
fully enclosed nodes and replaces the previous selection. If the box encloses
a group and its children, the group represents them in the selection. Escape
cancels without changing the prior selection. Box selection leaves the graph
and undo history intact.

Set `minimap: true` to show the diagram overview after the canvas is measured.
The rectangle shows the current viewport. Click the overview to center the
canvas on that point at the current zoom. This changes only the viewport.

Set `viewportControls: true` to show **Zoom in**, **Zoom out**, and **Fit view**
above the canvas. Zoom is centered on the visible canvas. The controls are
available in read-only views and work with standard button keyboard input.
